Notes:

-   The code for A2 was used as a starting point, making changes to several files, and removing some, to remove all uses of SimpleKit.
-   It wasn't made clear whether or not to hide "Values:" when no chart is selected (or more than 1 is), so I hid it, since it seems logical.
-   Certain borders that are 1px wide look thinner in HTML/CSS in comparison to SimpleKit (at least on my PC).
-   The requirements state there should be a 5px gap between the title row and the colour scheme row, even though the image appears to show a 10px gap. So, I followed the written requirements on this (5px).
-   Undoing an "add" action also restores the items selected before the operation, which is consistent with the behavior of undoing a "delete". See https://piazza.com/class/mebpgavdyln6sq/post/105.
-   Undoing an "edit" action brings back focus to the text field where the edit was made.
-   The EditPanel does not have a "greyed-out" overlay, unlike A2 (requirement #34 from A2), because it was not mentioned this time. Inputs are still disabled, though, when appropriate.
-   AI was not used to generate any code used in this project.
